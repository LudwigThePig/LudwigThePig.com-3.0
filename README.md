# Ludwig The Pig 3.0

[See Ludwig The Pig 2.0](https://github.com/LudwigThePig/LudwigThePig.com-2.0)

This is my third iteration of my website. The impetus for this iteration was ease of iteration. My prior website had a sophisticated backend and devops infrastructure, which was great a lesson in deploying dynamic websites but not a lot of fun to develop. I spend my days at work sniffing out edge cases and security vulnerabilities. I do not want to do that in my free time. So, I tore it down.

This site is static. Deployment is managed by Netlify. Releases occur whenever I feel like. It's a nice change of pace. This auto-devops setup allows me to focus on the problems that I actually find interesting -- namely, WebGl.

For as long as I am curious, this website will be a work in progress. I will be continually biting off and implementing new interactive 3D concepts.

# Current Features

(I have also implemented a physics system in [another repo](https://github.com/LudwigThePig/Pig-Phy). I will implement that here when the time is right.)
